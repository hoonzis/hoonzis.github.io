Pricer is a small library for pricing options and generating payoff charts.

Payoff charts show you the profit of an option based on the movement of the underlying security itself. You can create a payoff charts of any derivative (options, futures, convertible bonds). Multiple options traded in the same time form strategies which can be used to obtain different type of protection or leverage against the movements of the underlying stock.
