http://hoonzis.blogspot.com/2011/05/vs-2010-clr20r3-crash.html --- When
working on a Silverlight project I have encountered the following crash
and I was unable to open my solution in Visual Studio.\
\
Visual Studion 2010 Crash\
Problem Event Name: CLR20r3\
Core error: NullRefferenceException\
\
As the solution was composed of several project I have decided to remove
from the solution file one by one and this way see which project was
causing the error.\
I was quite lucky, it was the first on, that I have tried - the
Silverligt project.\
\
Here is the structure of VS 2010 solution file (.SLN file):\
\

``` {.prettyprint}
Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 11.00
# Visual Studio 2010
Project("{Project GUID") = "Project name1", "Project reference1", "{Reference GUID}"
EndProject
...
...
Project("{Project GUID") = "Project name2", "Project reference2", "{Reference GUID}"
EndProject
Global
...runtime configurations etc.
EndGlobal
```

\
So it is quite easy to remove one project reference just by deleting the
**Project - EndProject** part.\
\
Note that if your solution is under Team Foundation Server source
control, the solution file might be **read-only** so you will have to
change that in the properties of the file.\
\
Once you have removed the project causing the error you can just easily
add it to the solution from Visual Studio (Add Existing Project).\
\
Hope it helps.
