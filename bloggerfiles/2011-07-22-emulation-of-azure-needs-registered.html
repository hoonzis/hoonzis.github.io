While debugging Azure Web Role I have obtained error while Visual Studio debugger was attaching to the emulator.<br /><br />Here is a good blog which describes hot to diagnose this error:<br /><br /><a href="http://dunnry.com/blog/2011/07/14/HowToDiagnoseWindowsAzureErrorAttachingDebuggerErrors.aspx">http://dunnry.com/blog/2011/07/14/HowToDiagnoseWindowsAzureErrorAttachingDebuggerErrors.aspx</a><br /><br />At the core the issue was:<br /><br /><b>Handler "PageHandlerFactory-Integrated" has a bad module "ManagedPipelineHandler" in its module list</b><br /><br />I quickly found out what was the issue. Later to perform some testing I have uninstalled ASP.NET 4 extensions from my IIS and kept just the 3.5 versions (actually 2.0, because 3.5 were just framework extensions). So a quick solution <b>aspnet_regiis.exe -i</b> in 4 version folder will fix it.
