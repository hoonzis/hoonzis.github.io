This is just a quick post:<br /><br />When DataForm is not visible, then its ItemsSource collection is null. This can make sense, but it may also cause problems, imagine the following:<br /><br />The DataForm is in Expander. On a click of a button you want to expand the Expander and add new item to the DataForm:<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint"><br />MyExpander.IsExpanded = true;<br />//this call passes<br />MyDataForm.AddNewItem();<br /><br />//but here CurrentItem will be null<br />var vm = MyDataForm.CurrentItem as MyViewModel;<br /><br />//and here you will get NullPointerException<br />vm.MyProperty = "value";<br /></pre><br />The problem is that when you set <b>IsExpanded</b> to true, the UI does not get updated right by the way, so you will have to force it by calling <b>this.UpdateLayout()</b>. After this the <b>ItemsSource</b> collection will be binded to whatever enumeration you have set in the XAML and the next call of AddNewItem() will set the <b>CurrentItem</b> property of DataForm to a non-null value.
