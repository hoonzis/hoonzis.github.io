I have obtained the Error with code: 80073712 yesterday while installing
Service Pack 1 of Windows 7. I have no idea what was causing the
problem, I have fixed it by installing the following update:

<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821>

After installation of this pack, SP1 installed without problems.

Also I have run the System File Checker, which found some errors,
repaired them, but also found some errors which he could not repair. So
I don't know if it contributed to the fix of the problem.
