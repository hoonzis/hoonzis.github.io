<p>I have recently run into two separate issues while testing some F# data providers based code. I am using ReSharper's NUnit runner and sometimes NCrunch.</p> <h2>NCrunch issues</h2><p>NCrunch won't compile your solution when FSharp.Data is referenced. This component internally references FSharp.Data.DesignTime which has to be avaiable for the compilation - and NCrunch does not have those libs available, because the DLL is not referenced the standard way, but must be provided by Visual Studio.</p><p>The current solution is to reference FSharp.Data.DesignTime manually. If you are using nuget, than the DLL can be found in the pacakages foder as shown bellow:</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bhTeegAseTs/VMeJ7PPap_I/AAAAAAAAEMM/Dab5HZms5rM/s1600/reference_fsharpdata.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bhTeegAseTs/VMeJ7PPap_I/AAAAAAAAEMM/Dab5HZms5rM/s640/reference_fsharpdata.PNG" /></a></div><p>Note that I have tested and had the same issue with FSharp.Data 2.1.0 and 2.2.0.</p> <h2>NUnit runner issues</h2><p>NUnit did load the test correctly, but the test failed with <b>SystemMissingMethodException</b></p><p>Luckily the solution <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22608519/fsharp-data-system-missingmethodexception-when-calling-freebase-provider-from">can be found on StackOverflow</a> and was caused by the tested library being Portable Class Library instead of standard F# library.</p>
