It is quite difficult and confusing process to install a standalone SQL Server Management Studio 2008.<br />After you <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=08e52ac2-1d62-45f6-9a4a-4b76a8564a2b&DisplayLang=en">download the setup file</a>, you will see, that it is a 170mb installation package and when you run the installation you will be provided with a full SQL Server Express Intaller. <br /><br />So how to go on:<br /><br />-> SQLServer Installation Center<br />-> Select: <b>New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing installation</b><br />-> Setup Support Rules - <b>OK</b><br />!!! Add features to an existing instanace of SQL Server 2008 - this would be WRONG choice !!!<br />-> Select: <b>Perfom a new installation of SQL Server 2008</b><br />-> Select in the Shared Features: <b>Management Tools - Basic</b><br /><br />So even if you have already SQL Server Express intalled you can not add the Management Studio to the features. You have to pretend that you are installing a new copy of SQL Server!<br /><br />Topic is covered on <a href="http://www.asql.biz/Articoli/SQLX08/Art3_1.aspx#SSMSE">this blog</a>
