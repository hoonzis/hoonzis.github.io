Because I needed Linux for some school projects regarding opensource development I have decided to install it as Virtual Machine to Virtual PC.<br /><br />First advice - Linux guests are officially not supported for MS Windows Virtual PC, if you really don't need it don't do it.<br /><br />Second advice - Virtual PC supports hosting 64bit operating systems (but as Linux is not supported only Windows) - but in some cases I found that I was able to run only 32 bit version (OpenSuse, Fedora).<br /><br />What I have tried so far<br />------------------------<br /><br /><b>Ubuntu 9.10</b> - installation ok, but ater "Segmentation fault". After increasing memory amount from 800Mb to 1024Mb the os started, but the performance was REALLY slow. <a href="http://jagbarcelo.blogspot.com/2009/11/segmentation-fault-ubuntu-virtual-pc.html">Here is a possible workaround which I didn't tested.</a><br /><br /><b>Fedora 12</b> <br /><ul><li>version i686. I was not able to boot the disk. The screen just blanked at went of.</li><li>version i386. The installation started but after selecting "Install or upgrade" the virtual machine went off.</li><li>version x86_64. this version told me, that I can not use 64bit os on 32bit platform (I'am on 64 bits)</li></ul><br /><b>Debian 5.04</b> - Version i386 net install - after starting the installation the virtual pc went off.<br /><br /><b>OpenSuse</b><br /><ul><li>version x86_64 - this version told me, that I can not use 64bit os on 32bit platform (I'am on 64 bits)</li><li>Version i586 installed fine, but after the "1st configuration" did not finish and system did not boot up correctly.</li></ul><br /><b>Mandriva 2010</b> - version i586 - the installation did not start correctly<br /><br /><b>Slackware 13</b> - installation ok, it works now, but so far in the textmode.<br /><br />UPDATE: ok now it works fine with GNOME. <br /><br />4 basic steps:<br /><br />1) Install <a href="http://gnomeslackbuild.org/">GNOME version for Slackware.</a><br />2) Run <i>xorgsetup</i> to configure the XSERVER<br />3) Run <i>xwmconfig</i> to configure which X manager do you want to use - select GNOME.<br />4) Run <i>xinit</i> to start X Server<br /><br />To Install KDE you just need to add the KDEBASE packages (eg. from GNOME start the package management tool).<br /><br />If you want to use bigger resolution than 800x600(which is default), than you will have to modify your xorg.conf file, details can be found here:<br /><a href="http://demiliani.com/blog/archive/2004/03/18/1808.aspx">http://demiliani.com/blog/archive/2004/03/18/1808.aspx</a><br /><br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />OK - I was able to get Ubuntu tu run - but realllly slow. Slackware is so far working without a problem.
