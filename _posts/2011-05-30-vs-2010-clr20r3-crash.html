When working on a Silverlight project I have encountered the following crash and I was unable to open my solution in Visual Studio.<br /><br />Visual Studion 2010 Crash<br />Problem Event Name: CLR20r3<br />Core error: NullRefferenceException<br /><br />As the solution was composed of several project I have decided to remove from the solution file one by one and this way see which project was causing the error.<br />I was quite lucky, it was the first on, that I have tried - the Silverligt project.<br /><br />Here is the structure of VS 2010 solution file (.SLN file):<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint"><br />Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 11.00<br /># Visual Studio 2010<br />Project("{Project GUID") = "Project name1", "Project reference1", "{Reference GUID}"<br />EndProject<br />...<br />...<br />Project("{Project GUID") = "Project name2", "Project reference2", "{Reference GUID}"<br />EndProject<br />Global<br />...runtime configurations etc.<br />EndGlobal<br /></pre><br />So it is quite easy to remove one project reference just by deleting the <b>Project - EndProject</b> part.<br /><br />Note that if your solution is under Team Foundation Server source control, the solution file might be <b>read-only</b> so you will have to change that in the properties of the file.<br /><br />Once you have removed the project causing the error you can just easily add it to the solution from Visual Studio (Add Existing Project).<br /><br />Hope it helps.
