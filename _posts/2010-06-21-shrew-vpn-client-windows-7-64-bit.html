Like many other people on the internet I had to use Cisco VPN Client to connect to our network. First Cisco didn't support 64 bit, now they do support, but I am unable to install the 64bit client. I get this error during the installation:<br /><br /><b>Installation ended prematurely because of an error.</b><br /><br />Well I am using <b>Shrew VPN Client</b> which is freeware and allows to import the Cisco Client <b>pcf</b> configuration files.<br /><br />After the import and first try to connect it ended up just with <b>"bringing up tunnel ..."</b>.<br />I had to make one more manual step: Uncheck and Check again the <b>Shrew Soft Lightweight Filter</b> on the connection properties tab. (Configure the connection which connects you to internet).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fmvjrARTMYo/TB9vLL82RvI/AAAAAAAAAFo/4N826L85h-U/s1600/shrew_properties.PNG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 254px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fmvjrARTMYo/TB9vLL82RvI/AAAAAAAAAFo/4N826L85h-U/s320/shrew_properties.PNG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5485225109137802994" /></a><br /><br />After that everything worked ok for me.
