I was trying to compile Midnight-Commander from source and get it to run. I downloaded the source files using GIT and than went to the project folder and run the <b>./configure</b> script. Because it was on my newly installed OpenSuse machine I run into following errors and solved them by installing required components:<br /><br />maint/autopoint: line 421: /usr/share/gettext/archive.tar.gz: No such file or directory                                                                         <br />tar: This does not look like a tar archive                                      <br />tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors                         <br />cvs checkout: cannot find module `archive' - ignored                            <br />find: `archive': No such file or directory                                      <br />find: `archive': No such file or directory                                      <br />find: `archive': No such file or directory                                      <br />autopoint: *** infrastructure files for version 0.14.3 not found; this is autopoint from GNU gettext-tools 0.17                                                 <br />autopoint: *** Stop.    <br /><br /><b>-> install gettext-tools</b><br /><br />./autogen.sh: line 55: aclocal: command not found<br /><br /><b>-> install autogen & automake</b><br /><br />./autogen.sh: line 48: libtoolize: command not found<br /><br /><b>-> install libtool</b><br /><br />checking for GLIB... no<br />configure: error: glib-2.0 not found or version too old (must be >= 2.8)<br /><br /><b>-> install glib2-devel</b><br /><br />checking for slang/slang.h... no<br />configure: error: Slang header not found<br /><br /><b>-> Install slang and slang-devel</b><br /><br />After that I was able to run MAKE and the run the compiled project.
