- In order to install Ubuntu 20 one needs to deactivate Intel Rapid Storage Technology
- This can be done in the BIOS by switching to:

- Windows 10 won't boot in standard mode - one needs to boot in Safe Mode
- There are 2 ways to activate safe mode:
  -> Before rebooting windows (using MSConfig)
  -> After rebooting 

But in both cases the BitLocker key will be asked - key that you don't have and you are stucked.

So what is really needed as a step number one:
- Remove BitLocker encryption
